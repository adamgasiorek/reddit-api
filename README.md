# Questions

##### 1. Explain your choices regarding stack used as well as alternatives and their pros and cons
`I choose Angular7 and ngrx because i like ng architecutre and homogeneity in making projects.
Biggest pros of using these frameworks are scalability and nice tools in expanding. One of cons is definitely
time.`
#####  2. How would you go with application internationalisation?
`I would implement i18n module in AppModule. Then use pipe in view.`
#####  3. What could impact this application's performance most in longer term and what would be your ways to optimize it?
`Very long list. I would implement Virtual Scroll with Angular CDK`
#####  4. What if you had to make it work on lower-end devices and slow internet connection? What trade-offs would have to be made?
`I will implement pagination for mobile devices for list`
#####  5. How would you report and collect errors from application?
`We can collect errors in ngrx. We handle them in effects. We can send them automatically when it occurs.`

Development task:
Using Reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), design and implement modern frontend application for browsing articles from particular subreddits.

Resulting application should be available and fully functional on both desktops and mobile devices. Look-and-feel will have a significant impact on the rating.

There is no need to implement authentication, a login mechanism nor users management capabilities. Simply use read-only features provided by API.

Core requirements:
1. Switching between subreddits of your choice - i.e. Awww, memes, quantum, Music, BeAmazed.
   - The list of subreddits should be hardcoded in the app.
2. List of the articles from chosen subreddit.
   - List should be always sorted from newest to oldest articles
   - Expanding with infinite-scroll mechanism.
   - Searching by keyword feature.
3. Single article page with user comments.
   - Tree structure of comments should be noticeable

The type and amount of article data displayed on lists and single pages are unrestricted. Itâ€™s up to you and your sense of UX/UI.

Remember to provide tests. We don't require e2e tests (eg. selenium), but unit tests (components, utilities, reducers etc.) are a must!

Please keep in mind future development and project maintenance.

API hints:
1. Useful endpoints for this task are:
   - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_new
   - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search
   - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_comments_{article}
2. To receive JSON data format add '.json' suffix
   i.e.: https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/new.json - provides newest articles from subreddit 'Music'
